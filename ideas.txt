Design a pre-game, beginning-of-the-game, mid-game and after-game

model: decision tree (random forest, XGBoost), logistic regression, SVR

pre-game: after ban-pick phase, predict game result by champions banned and picked, 
plus their summoner spells. 

beginning of the game: with ban-pick information, and first blood, first tower, 
first rift herald, and first dragon, predict game result. 

mid-game: everything previously mentioned plus first baron, first inhibitor, 
tower kills / 2, dragon kills / 2, and reft herald kills. 

optional: after-game, more for game recap purpose
include all the information to aim to predict a model with high accuracy. 

Create an automated predictor where user could input associated game info and prediction
result will be outputed.
